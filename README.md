This project examines the feasibility of classifying phosphorus levels in orange trees using dendrometer data in a time series context. In collaboration with The Volcani Center and Ben-Gurion University, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) with LDA was used for feature selection, achieving high accuracy in cross-validation.
